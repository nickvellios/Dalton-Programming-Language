# Dalton Programming Language

Created by Nick Vellios

I was freshening up on Python and playing around with string manipulation.
I was testing the performance of manually parsing strings vs using regular
expressions and my curiousity grew and I began building out an interpreter
for this made up language.  Nothing was planned ahead, and the code mostly
reflects that.  It's very hacked together.  But hell, it works.  :)
